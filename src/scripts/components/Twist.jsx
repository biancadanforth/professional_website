                  The goal of this project was to design and build a chair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This project was part of an Art Studio course I took in my last quarter of graduate school at Stanford University. It was featured in Stanford's alumni magazine!

                <p>
                  I made a CAD model of the chair's frame in SolidWorks. I TIG-welded the frame, which is made of mild steel square tubing. I upholstered the chair using foam, leather and lycra.

                    I started looking everywhere for inspiration. I walked all over campus, visited designer furniture stores, flipped through visual art books at the library and sketched out the possibilities.

                  <p className="project-description">
                    As I looked through my ideas, I found a pattern: I was drawn to a dynamic, ostensibly unstable form.

                  <p className="project-description">
                    I converged on my final design based on the practical decision I had made earlier: do something partly familiar and partly new. I had TIG-welded before, but never worked with fabrics. That would be my process direction.

                    I knew the build phase needed to start as soon as possible. I got my hands on materials from a local supplier and set about practice welding joints similar to those I would have in my final frame.

                    At the same time, I needed to look outside the Stanford bubble for an upholstery expert. I asked fellow students in the shop and got a referral. I went to the local hobby store, bought some clearance spandex and set up a meeting.

                    Once I finalized my design, I set to work welding the final frame and made a fabric pattern for the base and top of the chair.

                    After seeing it at scale, I was dissatisfied with the original angle and length of the back of the chair. Thankfully, I did not have to scrap the entire frame. I just had to cut off the back, modify it as desired and re-weld it.

                    I really enjoyed this project, because it was one of the few projects I worked on at Stanford where I was in control of both the design and engineering.

                    <strong>I learned</strong> first-hand the tremendous value of human capital. I received so much useful advice from course alumni and their extended networks.

                  <p className="project-description">
                    In addition to the hard skills of basic upholstery and tube bending, I gained some project management skills as well. I surprised myself at times being ahead of schedule on project milestones.

                    My half familiar and half new approach was very successful in the end. I see my transition into web design and development along those lines as well: I already know programming and design methodology â€“ what is new are the languages and the medium.
